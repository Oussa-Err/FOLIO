      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>My name is Caio Augusto, I’m from Brazil and I’m 19 years old.</p>
      <p>
        I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open
        source, and the web platform.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source
        projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer
        and support other open source projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for technology was born when I was 5 years old, when I first
        used a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started as a Front-end Developer on 3/8/2020. Since then I have been
        dedicating about 12 hours a day to studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a huge passion for helping people who are just starting. Codes,
        movies, video games, music, podcast and studies are subjects that
        interest me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see that I am on the right path because I love helping people who are
        starting out, just as I was a beginner. Furthermore, I see the results
        that the dedicated hours bring.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time I usually read about reactive, asynchronous and
        object-oriented programming. I like to read Robert C. Martin's book
        series.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work as Fullstack developer using techs like React.js, Go, TypeScript,
        GraphQL and more.
