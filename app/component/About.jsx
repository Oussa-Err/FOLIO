      </h1>
      <p className="text-md md:text-xl">My name is Oussama, I’m from Morocco and I’m 22 years old.</p>
      <p className="text-sm md:text-lg">
        I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open
        source, and the web platform.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm md:text-lg">
        Aside from my Freelance, I like to create and contribute to open source
        projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer
        and support other open source projects.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm md:text-lg">
        My passion for technology was born when I was 5 years old, when I first
        used a computer.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm md:text-lg">
        I started as a Front-end Developer on 3/8/2022. Since then I have been
        dedicating about 12 hours a day to studies.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm md:text-lg">
        I have a huge passion for helping people who are just starting. Codes,
        movies, video games, music, podcast and studies are subjects that
        interest me.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm md:text-lg">
        I see that I am on the right path because I love helping people who are
        starting out, just as I was a beginner. Furthermore, I see the results
        that the dedicated hours bring.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm md:text-lg">
        In my spare time I usually read about reactive, asynchronous and
        object-oriented programming. I like to read Robert C. Martin's book
        series.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm md:text-lg">
        I am actively exploring new avenues within the tech industry and am
        eagerly open to fresh opportunities. I specialize in crafting dynamic
        web experiences using an array of cutting-edge technologies including
        React.js, Python, Node.js, and GraphQL, among others.
